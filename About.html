            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello! I'm Aparna Akula, a dedicated and enthusiastic professional on a rewarding journey 
                <br>in the field of web development. With a background enriched by the joys of motherhood—
                <br>raising two wonderful kids—I've found my true passion in creating innovative solutions 
                <br>through code.
            </p>
            <h3>Professional Journey:</h3>
            <p class="space">Currently, I am navigating the dynamic world of web development, constantly exploring 
                <br>new technologies and methodologies to stay at the forefront of this ever-evolving 
                <br>industry. My journey began with a curiosity-driven foray into coding, and it has 
                <br>since blossomed into a fulfilling career marked by continuous learning and exciting challenges.
            </p>
            <h3>Web Development Passion:</h3> 
            <p>I find immense joy in crafting elegant and functional websites, blending creativity with 
                <br>the precision of coding. From front-end design to back-end development, I thrive on 
                <br>turning ideas into tangible, user-friendly digital experiences. My goal is not just 
                <br>to write code but to create meaningful solutions that make a positive impact.
            </p>
